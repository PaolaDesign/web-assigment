          <h1>Our process looks like this:</h1>
          <p>
            All learning solutions the Future Investments learning team creates
            are grounded in the Tā Tātou Rautaki Akoranga | Our Waka Kotahi
            learning strategy. To help us design the best solutions to address
            learning needs we apply a human centred design thinking approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design thinking allows us to design with you. By understanding both
            yours and your end users desired outcomes, challenges, and
            assumptions we can accurately define the problems we are trying to
            solve. By taking a non-linear, iterative process we can innovate,
            prototype and test to ensure robust, fit for purpose learning
            solutions. By checking in early and often we save time and create
            solutions that work for our customers.
