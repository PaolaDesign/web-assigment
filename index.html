              Waka Kotahi has a goal to improve the performance of the land
              transport system and provide outcome-focused, evidenced-based,
              clear and stable investment direction leading to affordable
              investment decisions that support whole of Government outcomes. To
              enable this future focus, we need to equip the sector with the
              capabilities required to achieve this..

              A key way Waka Kotahi can support the uplift of sector capability
              is through providing learning opportunities. This document

              you, the business, to support investment capability outcomes.
